# Scheme Compiler
Tiny compiler for a subset of Scheme.
## Usage
```
chmod +x ./scheme-compiler
scheme-compiler [-h] [-o OUTPUT] [-d] [-S] filename
```

## Important Notes
- The compiler is not yet feature complete. It still lacks some essentials features.
- This is a learning project not meant to be a real usefull compiler.
- You can use option `-o -` to redirect the output to stdout and `-` as filename to read from stdin.
